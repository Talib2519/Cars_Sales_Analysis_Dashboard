I have created a Car Sales Analysis Dashboard that provides a complete overview of sales performance. It includes key metrics such as:

* **Total Units Sold**
* **Total Revenue Generated**
* **Total Number of Car Variants**

In the lower section of the dashboard, visual charts show:

* The **market value of each car brand**
* Which **car model generates the highest revenue**
* The **market value based on fuel type**

At the top left, there's a filter panel. For example, when I select *Audi*, the dashboard updates automatically:

* The **car image** changes to an Audi car
* The **units sold, revenue**, and **number of variants** get updated based on the selected brand

If more detailed insights are required, users can click on the **'Detailed Analysis'** button at the top right to access a second page.

On the **Detailed Analysis** page, users can see:

* All the previously shown information
* A **monthly sales trend**, which clearly shows that most car purchases happen at the beginning of the year and gradually decline over time
* Customer preference based on **transmission type**
* The **total tax paid**
